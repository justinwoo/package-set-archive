# The State Hook (useState)

This chapter hasn't been written yet, but you can read the corresponding entry in [the Hooks API reference](./07-Hooks-API.md).

It will offer a detailed walkthrough of using the state hook, along with a comparison to the equivalent Halogen component code. It will also include tips on avoiding stale state and notes on using state within `HookM`.

In the meantime, you can see the [examples](../examples/Example/Hooks) to see this hook in action.
