# HookM

This chapter hasn't been written yet.

It will offer a detailed explanation of the `HookM` monad, which is largely equivalent to `HalogenM` but with a slightly different approach to state. It will also describe why `HookM` is used as the action type in Hook components' HTML.

In the meantime, you can see the [examples](../examples/Example/Hooks) to see this type in action. There are also some tips available in [the Hooks API reference](./07-Hooks-API.md).

You may also wish to read the [Implementing UseWindowWidth](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/introducing-halogen-hooks/#implementing-usewindowwidth) section of the introduction to Halogen Hooks for more information.
