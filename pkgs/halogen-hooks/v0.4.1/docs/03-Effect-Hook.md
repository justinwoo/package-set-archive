# The Effect Hook (useLifecycleEffect, useTickEffect)

This chapter hasn't been written yet, but you can read the corresponding entry in [the Hooks API reference](./07-Hooks-API.md).

It will offer a detailed walkthrough of using the lifecycle / tickEffect hooks, along with a comparison to the equivalent Halogen component code using initializers, finalizers,`handleAction`, and `handleQuery`. It will also demonstrate how actions and `handleAction` can be entirely replaced using `HookM`, and how you can recreate this action pattern in your code if you enjoy it.

In the meantime, you can see the [examples](../examples/Example/Hooks) to see this hook in action.
