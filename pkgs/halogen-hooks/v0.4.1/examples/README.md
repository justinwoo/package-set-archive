# Halogen Hook Examples

The examples in this directory demonstrate how to use hooks to build ordinary Halogen components, and also demonstrate a few examples of what you can do with hooks that you couldn't do with regular components.

## View live examples

You can view and test the examples by bundling the project. Run these commands from
the root of the repository:

```sh
# Ensure you have installed dependencies
yarn install

# Bundle the examples to ./example/app.js
yarn bundle
```

Open `./example/index.html` to view the live examples.

## Contributing

I'd love to expand these examples in two ways:

- Direct comparisons between Hooks-based and ordinary Halogen components
- New custom hooks which showcase Hooks functionality

Please focus on comparisons and Hooks features that aren't already covered by the existing examples to help prevent these examples from becoming a maintenance burden.
