# Codegen


## Decription

This code is written in Typescript solely because it makes heavy use of the Typescript compiler, and it was easier to interact with the API in straight Typescript.

This code will codegen the PureScript props and functions for the major React Native components. It does this by parsing the typescript [type declaration](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-native/index.d.ts) file for React Native. For now this is a bit adhoc. If you look through the file, you'll notice that each component extends `React.Component<Props>`, so the codegen code looks for thesee classes and then finds the corresponding `Props` interface, which is then turned into PureScript code.

It works, but some dog-fooding is needed, which I'll be undertaking over the next few months
