-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `animating`
-- |        Whether to show the indicator (true, the default) or hide it (false).
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `color`
-- |        The foreground color of the spinner (default is gray).
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hidesWhenStopped`
-- |        Whether the indicator should hide when not animating (true by default).
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `size`
-- |        Size of the indicator.
-- |        Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.
-- |        enum('small', 'large')
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `size`
-- |        Size of the indicator.
-- |        Small has a height of 20, large has a height of 36.
-- |        enum('small', 'large')
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true the user won't be able to toggle the checkbox. Default value is false.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events

-- |        Used in case the props change removes the component.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with

-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `value`
-- |        The value of the checkbox. If true the checkbox will be turned on. Default value is false.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `date`
-- |        The currently selected date.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `locale`
-- |        The date picker locale.
-- | - `maximumDate`
-- |        Maximum date.
-- |        Restricts the range of possible date/time values.
-- | - `minimumDate`
-- |        Maximum date.
-- |        Restricts the range of possible date/time values.
-- | - `minuteInterval`
-- |        enum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30)
-- |        The interval at which minutes can be selected.
-- | - `mode`
-- |        enum('date', 'time', 'datetime')
-- |        The date picker mode.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onDateChange`
-- |        Date change handler.
-- |        This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.
-- |        The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).

-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.

-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.

-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `timeZoneOffsetInMinutes`
-- |        Timezone offset in minutes.
-- |        By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset.
-- |        For instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 * 60.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `date`
-- |        The currently selected date.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `locale`
-- |        The date picker locale.
-- | - `maximumDate`
-- |        Maximum date.
-- |        Restricts the range of possible date/time values.
-- | - `minimumDate`
-- |        Maximum date.
-- |        Restricts the range of possible date/time values.
-- | - `minuteInterval`
-- |        enum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 10, 12, 15, 20, 30)
-- |        The interval at which minutes can be selected.
-- | - `mode`
-- |        enum('date', 'time', 'datetime')
-- |        The date picker mode.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onDateChange`
-- |        Date change handler.
-- |        This is called when the user changes the date or time in the UI.
-- |        The first and only argument is a Date object representing the new date and time.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `timeZoneOffsetInMinutes`
-- |        Timezone offset in minutes.
-- |        By default, the date picker will use the device's timezone. With this parameter, it is possible to force a certain timezone offset.
-- |        For instance, to show times in Pacific Standard Time, pass -7 * 60.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`

-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.

-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `drawerBackgroundColor`
-- |        Specifies the background color of the drawer. The default value
-- |        is white. If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.
-- |        Example:
-- |        return (
-- |           <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor="rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">
-- |           </DrawerLayoutAndroid>
-- |        );
-- | - `drawerLockMode`
-- |        Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked
-- |        in 3 states:
-- |        - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond
-- |           (open/close) to touch gestures.
-- |        - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not
-- |           respond to gestures.
-- |        - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and
-- |           not respond to gestures. The drawer may still be opened and
-- |           closed programmatically (openDrawer/closeDrawer).
-- | - `drawerPosition`
-- |        Specifies the side of the screen from which the drawer will slide in.
-- |        enum(DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Left, DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Right)
-- | - `drawerWidth`
-- |        Specifies the width of the drawer, more precisely the width of the
-- |        view that be pulled in from the edge of the window.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with

-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |        - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |        - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- | - `nativeID`

-- | - `onDrawerStateChanged`
-- |        Function called when the drawer state has changed.
-- |        The drawer can be in 3 states:
-- |        - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation
-- |           view happening at the time
-- |        - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the
-- |           navigation view
-- |        - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the

-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderNavigationView`
-- |        The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the
-- |        screen and can be pulled in.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `statusBarBackgroundColor`
-- |        Make the drawer take the entire screen and draw the background of
-- |        the status bar to allow it to open over the status bar. It will
-- |        only have an effect on API 21+.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |  __*see* DrawerLayoutAndroid.android.js__
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `drawerBackgroundColor`
-- |        Specifies the background color of the drawer. The default value
-- |        is white. If you want to set the opacity of the drawer, use rgba.
-- |        Example:
-- |        return (
-- |           <DrawerLayoutAndroid drawerBackgroundColor="rgba(0,0,0,0.5)">
-- |           </DrawerLayoutAndroid>
-- |        );
-- | - `drawerLockMode`
-- |        Specifies the lock mode of the drawer. The drawer can be locked
-- |        in 3 states:
-- |        - unlocked (default), meaning that the drawer will respond
-- |           (open/close) to touch gestures.
-- |        - locked-closed, meaning that the drawer will stay closed and not
-- |           respond to gestures.
-- |        - locked-open, meaning that the drawer will stay opened and
-- |           not respond to gestures. The drawer may still be opened and
-- |           closed programmatically (openDrawer/closeDrawer).
-- | - `drawerPosition`
-- |        Specifies the side of the screen from which the drawer will slide in.
-- |        enum(DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Left, DrawerLayoutAndroid.positions.Right)
-- | - `drawerWidth`
-- |        Specifies the width of the drawer, more precisely the width of the
-- |        view that be pulled in from the edge of the window.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |        - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |        - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onDrawerClose`
-- |        Function called whenever the navigation view has been closed.
-- | - `onDrawerOpen`
-- |        Function called whenever the navigation view has been opened.
-- | - `onDrawerSlide`
-- |        Function called whenever there is an interaction with the navigation view.
-- | - `onDrawerStateChanged`
-- |        Function called when the drawer state has changed.
-- |        The drawer can be in 3 states:
-- |        - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the navigation
-- |           view happening at the time
-- |        - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the
-- |           navigation view
-- |        - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the
-- |           navigation view, and the navigation view is now finishing
-- |           it's closing or opening animation
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,

-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.

-- | - `renderNavigationView`
-- |        The navigation view that will be rendered to the side of the
-- |        screen and can be pulled in.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:

-- | - `ItemSeparatorComponent`
-- |        Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom
-- | - `ListEmptyComponent`
-- |        Rendered when the list is empty.
-- | - `ListFooterComponent`
-- |        Rendered at the very end of the list.
-- | - `ListHeaderComponent`
-- |        Rendered at the very beginning of the list.
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `columnWrapperStyle`
-- |        Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `data`
-- |        For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,
-- |        like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.
-- | - `debug`
-- |        `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and
-- |        implementation, but with a significant perf hit.
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `disableVirtualization`
-- |        DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully
-- |        unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable
-- |        this for debugging purposes.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `extraData`
-- |        A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).
-- |        If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,
-- |        stick it here and treat it immutably.
-- | - `getItem`
-- |        A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.
-- | - `getItemCount`
-- |        Determines how many items are in the data blob.
-- | - `getItemLayout`
-- |        `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic
-- |        content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,
-- |        and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:
-- |        ```
-- |             * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
-- |             *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}
-- |             * )}
-- |             * ```
-- |        Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify
-- |        `ItemSeparatorComponent`.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `initialNumToRender`
-- |        How many items to render in the initial batch
-- | - `initialScrollIndex`
-- |        Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `inverted`
-- |        Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyExtractor`
-- |        Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching
-- |        and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then
-- |        falls back to using the index, like React does.
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `legacyImplementation`
-- |        Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList
-- | - `maxToRenderPerBatch`
-- |        The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at
-- |        once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may
-- |        interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `numColumns`
-- |        Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.
-- |        Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onEndReached`
-- |        Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.
-- | - `onEndReachedThreshold`
-- |        How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the
-- |        list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.
-- |        Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is
-- |        within half the visible length of the list.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onRefresh`
-- |        If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for "Pull to Refresh" functionality.
-- |        Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onScrollToIndexFailed`
-- |        Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.
-- |        Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far
-- |        as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onViewableItemsChanged`
-- |        Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `progressViewOffset`
-- |        Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `refreshing`
-- |        Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.
-- |        This may improve scroll performance for large lists.
-- | - `renderItem`
-- |        Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:
-- |        ```
-- |             * _renderItem = ({item}) => (
-- |             *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>
-- |             *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>
-- |             *   <TouchableOpacity/>
-- |             * );
-- |             * ...
-- |             * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />
-- |             * ```
-- |        Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.
-- | - `renderScrollComponent`
-- |        Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`
-- |        Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off
-- |        screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.
-- | - `viewabilityConfig`
-- |        See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.
-- | - `windowSize`
-- |        Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of
-- |        visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will
-- |        render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing
-- |        this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the
-- |        chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | - `ItemSeparatorComponent`
-- |        Rendered in between each item, but not at the top or bottom
-- | - `ListEmptyComponent`
-- |        Rendered when the list is empty.
-- | - `ListFooterComponent`
-- |        Rendered at the very end of the list.
-- | - `ListHeaderComponent`
-- |        Rendered at the very beginning of the list.
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `columnWrapperStyle`
-- |        Optional custom style for multi-item rows generated when numColumns > 1
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `data`
-- |        For simplicity, data is just a plain array. If you want to use something else,
-- |        like an immutable list, use the underlying VirtualizedList directly.
-- | - `debug`
-- |        `debug` will turn on extra logging and visual overlays to aid with debugging both usage and
-- |        implementation, but with a significant perf hit.
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `disableVirtualization`
-- |        DEPRECATED: Virtualization provides significant performance and memory optimizations, but fully
-- |        unmounts react instances that are outside of the render window. You should only need to disable
-- |        this for debugging purposes.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `extraData`
-- |        A marker property for telling the list to re-render (since it implements PureComponent).
-- |        If any of your `renderItem`, Header, Footer, etc. functions depend on anything outside of the `data` prop,
-- |        stick it here and treat it immutably.
-- | - `getItem`
-- |        A generic accessor for extracting an item from any sort of data blob.
-- | - `getItemCount`
-- |        Determines how many items are in the data blob.
-- | - `getItemLayout`
-- |        `getItemLayout` is an optional optimization that lets us skip measurement of dynamic
-- |        content if you know the height of items a priori. getItemLayout is the most efficient,
-- |        and is easy to use if you have fixed height items, for example:
-- |        ```
-- |             * getItemLayout={(data, index) => (
-- |             *   {length: ITEM_HEIGHT, offset: ITEM_HEIGHT * index, index}
-- |             * )}
-- |             * ```
-- |        Remember to include separator length (height or width) in your offset calculation if you specify
-- |        `ItemSeparatorComponent`.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        If true, renders items next to each other horizontally instead of stacked vertically.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `initialNumToRender`
-- |        How many items to render in the initial batch
-- | - `initialScrollIndex`
-- |        Instead of starting at the top with the first item, start at initialScrollIndex
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `inverted`
-- |        Reverses the direction of scroll. Uses scale transforms of -1.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyExtractor`
-- |        Used to extract a unique key for a given item at the specified index. Key is used for caching
-- |        and as the react key to track item re-ordering. The default extractor checks `item.key`, then
-- |        falls back to using the index, like React does.
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `legacyImplementation`
-- |        Uses legacy MetroListView instead of default VirtualizedSectionList
-- | - `maxToRenderPerBatch`
-- |        The maximum number of items to render in each incremental render batch. The more rendered at
-- |        once, the better the fill rate, but responsiveness my suffer because rendering content may
-- |        interfere with responding to button taps or other interactions.
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `numColumns`
-- |        Multiple columns can only be rendered with `horizontal={false}` and will zig-zag like a `flexWrap` layout.
-- |        Items should all be the same height - masonry layouts are not supported.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onEndReached`
-- |        Called once when the scroll position gets within onEndReachedThreshold of the rendered content.
-- | - `onEndReachedThreshold`
-- |        How far from the end (in units of visible length of the list) the bottom edge of the
-- |        list must be from the end of the content to trigger the `onEndReached` callback.
-- |        Thus a value of 0.5 will trigger `onEndReached` when the end of the content is
-- |        within half the visible length of the list.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onRefresh`
-- |        If provided, a standard RefreshControl will be added for "Pull to Refresh" functionality.
-- |        Make sure to also set the refreshing prop correctly.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onScrollToIndexFailed`
-- |        Used to handle failures when scrolling to an index that has not been measured yet.
-- |        Recommended action is to either compute your own offset and `scrollTo` it, or scroll as far
-- |        as possible and then try again after more items have been rendered.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onViewableItemsChanged`
-- |        Called when the viewability of rows changes, as defined by the `viewablePercentThreshold` prop.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `progressViewOffset`
-- |        Set this when offset is needed for the loading indicator to show correctly.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `refreshing`
-- |        Set this true while waiting for new data from a refresh.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        Note: may have bugs (missing content) in some circumstances - use at your own risk.
-- |        This may improve scroll performance for large lists.
-- | - `renderItem`
-- |        Takes an item from data and renders it into the list. Typical usage:
-- |        ```
-- |             * _renderItem = ({item}) => (
-- |             *   <TouchableOpacity onPress={() => this._onPress(item)}>
-- |             *     <Text>{item.title}</Text>
-- |             *   <TouchableOpacity/>
-- |             * );
-- |             * ...
-- |             * <FlatList data={[{title: 'Title Text', key: 'item1'}]} renderItem={this._renderItem} />
-- |             * ```
-- |        Provides additional metadata like `index` if you need it.
-- | - `renderScrollComponent`
-- |        Render a custom scroll component, e.g. with a differently styled `RefreshControl`.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `updateCellsBatchingPeriod`
-- |        Amount of time between low-pri item render batches, e.g. for rendering items quite a ways off
-- |        screen. Similar fill rate/responsiveness tradeoff as `maxToRenderPerBatch`.
-- | - `viewabilityConfig`
-- |        See `ViewabilityHelper` for flow type and further documentation.
-- | - `windowSize`
-- |        Determines the maximum number of items rendered outside of the visible area, in units of
-- |        visible lengths. So if your list fills the screen, then `windowSize={21}` (the default) will
-- |        render the visible screen area plus up to 10 screens above and 10 below the viewport. Reducing
-- |        this number will reduce memory consumption and may improve performance, but will increase the
-- |        chance that fast scrolling may reveal momentary blank areas of unrendered content.
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `blurRadius`
-- |        blurRadius: the blur radius of the blur filter added to the image
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `capInsets`
-- |        When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified by capInsets will stay a fixed size,
-- |        but the center content and borders of the image will be stretched.
-- |        This is useful for creating resizable rounded buttons, shadows, and other resizable assets.
-- |        More info on Apple documentation
-- | - `defaultSource`
-- |        A static image to display while downloading the final image off the network.
-- | - `fadeDuration`
-- |        Duration of fade in animation.
-- | - `height`
-- |        Required if loading images via 'uri' from drawable folder on Android
-- |        Explanation: https://medium.com/@adamjacobb/react-native-performance-images-adf5843e120
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `loadingIndicatorSource`
-- |        similarly to `source`, this property represents the resource used to render
-- |        the loading indicator for the image, displayed until image is ready to be
-- |        displayed, typically after when it got downloaded from network.
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onError`
-- |        Invoked on load error with {nativeEvent: {error}}
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        onLayout function
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height} }}.

-- | - `onProgress`
-- |        Invoked on download progress with {nativeEvent: {loaded, total}}
-- | - `resizeMethod`
-- |        The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions
-- |        differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.
-- |        - `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.
-- |        - `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it
-- |        gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger
-- |        than the view.
-- |        - `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is
-- |        faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This
-- |        should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the
-- |        image is slightly bigger than the view.
-- |        More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at http://frescolib.org/docs/resizing-rotating.html.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `resizeMode`
-- |        Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw
-- |        image dimensions.
-- |        'cover': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
-- |        so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal
-- |        to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
-- |        'contain': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
-- |        so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to
-- |        or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
-- |        'stretch': Scale width and height independently, This may change the
-- |        aspect ratio of the src.
-- |        'repeat': Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view.
-- |        The image will keep it's size and aspect ratio. (iOS only)
-- |        'center': Scale the image down so that it is completely visible,
-- |        if bigger than the area of the view.
-- |        The image will not be scaled up.
-- | - `source`
-- |        The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).
-- |        This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments.
-- |        The native side will then choose the best uri to display based on the measured size of the image container.
-- |        A cache property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache.

-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to

-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.

-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.

-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.

-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `blurRadius`
-- |        blurRadius: the blur radius of the blur filter added to the image
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `capInsets`
-- |        When the image is resized, the corners of the size specified by capInsets will stay a fixed size,
-- |        but the center content and borders of the image will be stretched.
-- |        This is useful for creating resizable rounded buttons, shadows, and other resizable assets.
-- |        More info on Apple documentation
-- | - `defaultSource`
-- |        A static image to display while downloading the final image off the network.

-- |        Duration of fade in animation.
-- | - `height`
-- |        Required if loading images via 'uri' from drawable folder on Android
-- |        Explanation: https://medium.com/@adamjacobb/react-native-performance-images-adf5843e120
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `loadingIndicatorSource`
-- |        similarly to `source`, this property represents the resource used to render
-- |        the loading indicator for the image, displayed until image is ready to be
-- |        displayed, typically after when it got downloaded from network.
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onError`
-- |        Invoked on load error with {nativeEvent: {error}}
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        onLayout function
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height} }}.
-- | - `onLoad`
-- |        Invoked when load completes successfully
-- |        { source: { url, height, width } }.
-- | - `onLoadEnd`
-- |        Invoked when load either succeeds or fails
-- | - `onLoadStart`
-- |        Invoked on load start
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onPartialLoad`
-- |        Invoked when a partial load of the image is complete. The definition of
-- |        what constitutes a "partial load" is loader specific though this is meant
-- |        for progressive JPEG loads.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onProgress`
-- |        Invoked on download progress with {nativeEvent: {loaded, total}}
-- | - `resizeMethod`
-- |        The mechanism that should be used to resize the image when the image's dimensions
-- |        differ from the image view's dimensions. Defaults to `auto`.
-- |        - `auto`: Use heuristics to pick between `resize` and `scale`.
-- |        - `resize`: A software operation which changes the encoded image in memory before it
-- |        gets decoded. This should be used instead of `scale` when the image is much larger
-- |        than the view.
-- |        - `scale`: The image gets drawn downscaled or upscaled. Compared to `resize`, `scale` is
-- |        faster (usually hardware accelerated) and produces higher quality images. This
-- |        should be used if the image is smaller than the view. It should also be used if the
-- |        image is slightly bigger than the view.
-- |        More details about `resize` and `scale` can be found at http://frescolib.org/docs/resizing-rotating.html.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `resizeMode`
-- |        Determines how to resize the image when the frame doesn't match the raw
-- |        image dimensions.
-- |        'cover': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
-- |        so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal
-- |        to or larger than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
-- |        'contain': Scale the image uniformly (maintain the image's aspect ratio)
-- |        so that both dimensions (width and height) of the image will be equal to
-- |        or less than the corresponding dimension of the view (minus padding).
-- |        'stretch': Scale width and height independently, This may change the
-- |        aspect ratio of the src.
-- |        'repeat': Repeat the image to cover the frame of the view.
-- |        The image will keep it's size and aspect ratio. (iOS only)
-- |        'center': Scale the image down so that it is completely visible,
-- |        if bigger than the area of the view.
-- |        The image will not be scaled up.
-- | - `source`
-- |        The image source (either a remote URL or a local file resource).
-- |        This prop can also contain several remote URLs, specified together with their width and height and potentially with scale/other URI arguments.
-- |        The native side will then choose the best uri to display based on the measured size of the image container.
-- |        A cache property can be added to control how networked request interacts with the local cache.
-- |        The currently supported formats are png, jpg, jpeg, bmp, gif, webp (Android only), psd (iOS only).
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        A unique identifier for this element to be used in UI Automation testing scripts.
-- | - `width`
-- |        Required if loading images via 'uri' from drawable folder on Android.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        The style of the content container(View) when behavior is 'position'.
-- | - `enabled`
-- |        Enables or disables the KeyboardAvoidingView.
-- |        Default is true
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardVerticalOffset`
-- |        This is the distance between the top of the user screen and the react native view,
-- |        may be non-zero in some use cases.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#props>
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `dataSource`
-- |        An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `enableEmptySections`
-- |        Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.
-- |        In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by
-- |        default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not
-- |        desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from
-- |        sectionID object.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row
-- |        instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `initialListSize`
-- |        How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make
-- |        it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of
-- |        over the course of multiple frames.
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onChangeVisibleRows`
-- |        (visibleRows, changedRows) => void
-- |        Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps
-- |        { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and
-- |        `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows
-- |        that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and
-- |        false indicating the view has moved out of view.
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onEndReached`
-- |        Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled
-- |        to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll
-- |        event is provided.
-- | - `onEndReachedThreshold`
-- |        Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pageSize`
-- |        Number of rows to render per event loop.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of
-- |        large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row
-- |        containers.  Use at your own risk.
-- | - `renderFooter`
-- |        () => renderable
-- |        The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)
-- |        on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them
-- |        in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always
-- |        at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.
-- | - `renderHeader`
-- |        () => renderable
-- |        The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)
-- |        on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them
-- |        in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always
-- |        at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.
-- | - `renderRow`
-- |        (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable
-- |        Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return
-- |        a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data
-- |        is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to
-- |        provide custom extractors.
-- | - `renderScrollComponent`
-- |        A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.
-- |        Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.
-- | - `renderSectionHeader`
-- |        (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable
-- |        If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky
-- |        behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the
-- |        section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will
-- |        stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section
-- |        header.
-- | - `renderSeparator`
-- |        (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable
-- |        If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row
-- |        but not the last row if there is a section header below.
-- |        Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollRenderAheadDistance`
-- |        How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in
-- |        pixels.
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`
-- |        Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the
-- |        content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it
-- |        will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This
-- |        property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default
-- |        on iOS because of typical platform standards.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/listview.html#props>
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `dataSource`
-- |        An instance of [ListView.DataSource](docs/listviewdatasource.html) to use
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `enableEmptySections`
-- |        Flag indicating whether empty section headers should be rendered.
-- |        In the future release empty section headers will be rendered by
-- |        default, and the flag will be deprecated. If empty sections are not
-- |        desired to be rendered their indices should be excluded from
-- |        sectionID object.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row
-- |        instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `initialListSize`
-- |        How many rows to render on initial component mount.  Use this to make
-- |        it so that the first screen worth of data apears at one time instead of
-- |        over the course of multiple frames.
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onChangeVisibleRows`
-- |        (visibleRows, changedRows) => void
-- |        Called when the set of visible rows changes.  `visibleRows` maps
-- |        { sectionID: { rowID: true }} for all the visible rows, and
-- |        `changedRows` maps { sectionID: { rowID: true | false }} for the rows
-- |        that have changed their visibility, with true indicating visible, and
-- |        false indicating the view has moved out of view.
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onEndReached`
-- |        Called when all rows have been rendered and the list has been scrolled
-- |        to within onEndReachedThreshold of the bottom.  The native scroll
-- |        event is provided.
-- | - `onEndReachedThreshold`
-- |        Threshold in pixels for onEndReached.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pageSize`
-- |        Number of rows to render per event loop.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        A performance optimization for improving scroll perf of
-- |        large lists, used in conjunction with overflow: 'hidden' on the row
-- |        containers.  Use at your own risk.
-- | - `renderFooter`
-- |        () => renderable
-- |        The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)
-- |        on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them
-- |        in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always
-- |        at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.
-- | - `renderHeader`
-- |        () => renderable
-- |        The header and footer are always rendered (if these props are provided)
-- |        on every render pass.  If they are expensive to re-render, wrap them
-- |        in StaticContainer or other mechanism as appropriate.  Footer is always
-- |        at the bottom of the list, and header at the top, on every render pass.
-- | - `renderRow`
-- |        (rowData, sectionID, rowID) => renderable
-- |        Takes a data entry from the data source and its ids and should return
-- |        a renderable component to be rendered as the row.  By default the data
-- |        is exactly what was put into the data source, but it's also possible to
-- |        provide custom extractors.
-- | - `renderScrollComponent`
-- |        A function that returns the scrollable component in which the list rows are rendered.
-- |        Defaults to returning a ScrollView with the given props.
-- | - `renderSectionHeader`
-- |        (sectionData, sectionID) => renderable
-- |        If provided, a sticky header is rendered for this section.  The sticky
-- |        behavior means that it will scroll with the content at the top of the
-- |        section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it will
-- |        stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section
-- |        header.
-- | - `renderSeparator`
-- |        (sectionID, rowID, adjacentRowHighlighted) => renderable
-- |        If provided, a renderable component to be rendered as the separator below each row
-- |        but not the last row if there is a section header below.
-- |        Take a sectionID and rowID of the row above and whether its adjacent row is highlighted.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollRenderAheadDistance`
-- |        How early to start rendering rows before they come on screen, in
-- |        pixels.
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example, passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `stickySectionHeadersEnabled`
-- |        Makes the sections headers sticky. The sticky behavior means that it will scroll with the
-- |        content at the top of the section until it reaches the top of the screen, at which point it
-- |        will stick to the top until it is pushed off the screen by the next section header. This
-- |        property is not supported in conjunction with `horizontal={true}`. Only enabled by default
-- |        on iOS because of typical platform standards.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release

-- | - `barTintColor`
-- |        The default background color of the navigation bar.
-- | - `initialRoute`

-- | - `interactivePopGestureEnabled`
-- |        Boolean value that indicates whether the interactive pop gesture is

-- | - `barTintColor`
-- |        The default background color of the navigation bar.
-- | - `initialRoute`
-- |        NavigatorIOS uses "route" objects to identify child views, their props, and navigation bar configuration.
-- |        "push" and all the other navigation operations expect routes to be like this
-- | - `interactivePopGestureEnabled`
-- |        Boolean value that indicates whether the interactive pop gesture is
-- |        enabled. This is useful for enabling/disabling the back swipe navigation
-- |        gesture.
-- |        If this prop is not provided, the default behavior is for the back swipe
-- |        gesture to be enabled when the navigation bar is shown and disabled when
-- |        the navigation bar is hidden. Once you've provided the
-- |        `interactivePopGestureEnabled` prop, you can never restore the default
-- |        behavior.
-- | - `itemWrapperStyle`
-- |        The default wrapper style for components in the navigator.
-- |        A common use case is to set the backgroundColor for every page
-- | - `navigationBarHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value that indicates whether the navigation bar is hidden
-- | - `shadowHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value that indicates whether to hide the 1px hairline shadow
-- | - `style`
-- |        NOT IN THE DOC BUT IN THE EXAMPLES
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        The color used for buttons in the navigation bar
-- | - `titleTextColor`
-- |        The text color of the navigation bar title
-- | - `translucent`
-- |        A Boolean value that indicates whether the navigation bar is translucent

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__

-- |        On Android, specifies how to display the selection items when the user taps on the picker:
-- |           - 'dialog': Show a modal dialog. This is the default.
-- |           - 'dropdown': Shows a dropdown anchored to the picker view
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onValueChange`
-- |        Callback for when an item is selected. This is called with the
-- |        following parameters:
-- |        - itemValue: the value prop of the item that was selected
-- |        - itemPosition: the index of the selected item in this picker
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `prompt`
-- |        Prompt string for this picker, used on Android in dialog mode as the title of the dialog.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `selectedValue`
-- |        Value matching value of one of the items.
-- |        Can be a string or an integer.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `testId`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |  __*see* ProgressBarAndroid.android.js__
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `color`
-- |        Color of the progress bar.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indeterminate`
-- |        If the progress bar will show indeterminate progress.
-- |        Note that this can only be false if styleAttr is Horizontal.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children

-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.

-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `styleAttr`
-- |        Style of the ProgressBar. One of:
-- |           Horizontal
-- |           Normal (default)
-- |           Small
-- |           Large
-- |           Inverse
-- |           SmallInverse
-- |           LargeInverse
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `progress`
-- |        The progress value (between 0 and 1).
-- | - `progressImage`
-- |        A stretchable image to display as the progress bar.
-- | - `progressTintColor`
-- |        The tint color of the progress bar itself.
-- | - `progressViewStyle`
-- |        The progress bar style.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `trackImage`
-- |        A stretchable image to display behind the progress bar.
-- | - `trackTintColor`
-- |        The tint color of the progress bar track.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row
-- |        instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is
-- |        `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.
-- |        This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is
-- |        false.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `colors`
-- |        The colors (at least one) that will be used to draw the refresh indicator.
-- | - `enabled`
-- |        Whether the pull to refresh functionality is enabled.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onRefresh`
-- |        Called when the view starts refreshing.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `progressBackgroundColor`
-- |        The background color of the refresh indicator.
-- | - `progressViewOffset`
-- |        Progress view top offset
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `refreshing`
-- |        Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `size`
-- |        Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        The color of the refresh indicator.
-- | - `title`
-- |        The title displayed under the refresh indicator.
-- | - `titleColor`
-- |        Title color.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onRefresh`
-- |        Called when the view starts refreshing.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `progressBackgroundColor`
-- |        The background color of the refresh indicator.
-- | - `progressViewOffset`
-- |        Progress view top offset
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `refreshing`
-- |        Whether the view should be indicating an active refresh.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `size`
-- |        Size of the refresh indicator, see RefreshControl.SIZE.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        The color of the refresh indicator.
-- | - `title`
-- |        The title displayed under the refresh indicator.
-- | - `titleColor`
-- |        Title color.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `alwaysBounceHorizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces horizontally when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is true when `horizontal={true}` and false otherwise.
-- | - `alwaysBounceVertical`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces vertically when it reaches the end
-- |        even if the content is smaller than the scroll view itself. The default
-- |        value is false when `horizontal={true}` and true otherwise.
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether iOS should automatically adjust the content inset for scroll views that are placed behind a navigation bar or tab bar/ toolbar.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        When true the scroll view bounces when it reaches the end of the
-- |        content if the content is larger then the scroll view along the axis of
-- |        the scroll direction. When false it disables all bouncing even if
-- |        the `alwaysBounce*` props are true. The default value is true.
-- | - `bouncesZoom`
-- |        When true gestures can drive zoom past min/max and the zoom will animate
-- |        to the min/max value at gesture end otherwise the zoom will not exceed
-- |        the limits.
-- | - `canCancelContentTouches`
-- |        When false once tracking starts won't try to drag if the touch moves.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `centerContent`
-- |        When true the scroll view automatically centers the content when the
-- |        content is smaller than the scroll view bounds; when the content is
-- |        larger than the scroll view this property has no effect. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentContainerStyle`
-- |        These styles will be applied to the scroll view content container which
-- |        wraps all of the child views. Example:
-- |           return (
-- |             <ScrollView contentContainerStyle={styles.contentContainer}>
-- |             </ScrollView>
-- |           );
-- |           ...
-- |           const styles = StyleSheet.create({
-- |             contentContainer: {
-- |               paddingVertical: 20
-- |             }
-- |           });
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view content is inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `contentInsetAdjustmentBehavior`
-- |        This property specifies how the safe area insets are used to modify the content area of the scroll view.
-- |        The default value of this property must be 'automatic'. But the default value is 'never' until RN@0.51.
-- | - `contentOffset`
-- |        Used to manually set the starting scroll offset.
-- |        The default value is {x: 0, y: 0}
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll view
-- |        decelerates after the user lifts their finger. Reasonable choices include
-- |           - Normal: 0.998 (the default)
-- |           - Fast: 0.9
-- | - `directionalLockEnabled`
-- |        When true the ScrollView will try to lock to only vertical or horizontal
-- |        scrolling while dragging.  The default value is false.
-- | - `endFillColor`
-- |        Sometimes a scrollview takes up more space than its content fills.
-- |        When this is the case, this prop will fill the rest of the
-- |        scrollview with a color to avoid setting a background and creating
-- |        unnecessary overdraw. This is an advanced optimization that is not
-- |        needed in the general case.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `horizontal`
-- |        When true the scroll view's children are arranged horizontally in a row
-- |        instead of vertically in a column. The default value is false.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `indicatorStyle`
-- |        The style of the scroll indicators.
-- |        - default (the default), same as black.
-- |        - black, scroll indicator is black. This style is good against
-- |           a white content background.
-- |        - white, scroll indicator is white. This style is good against
-- |           a black content background.
-- | - `invertStickyHeaders`
-- |        If sticky headers should stick at the bottom instead of the top of the
-- |        ScrollView. This is usually used with inverted ScrollViews.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default) drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'onDrag' the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- |           - 'interactive' the keyboard is dismissed interactively with the drag
-- |             and moves in synchrony with the touch; dragging upwards cancels the
-- |             dismissal.
-- | - `keyboardShouldPersistTaps`
-- |        Determines when the keyboard should stay visible after a tap.
-- |        - 'never' (the default), tapping outside of the focused text input when the keyboard is up dismisses the keyboard. When this happens, children won't receive the tap.
-- |        - 'always', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically, and the scroll view will not catch taps, but children of the scroll view can catch taps.
-- |        - 'handled', the keyboard will not dismiss automatically when the tap was handled by a children, (or captured by an ancestor).
-- |        - false, deprecated, use 'never' instead
-- |        - true, deprecated, use 'always' instead
-- | - `maximumZoomScale`
-- |        The maximum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `minimumZoomScale`
-- |        The minimum allowed zoom scale. The default value is 1.0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `nestedScrollEnabled`
-- |        Enables nested scrolling for Android API level 21+. Nested scrolling is supported by default on iOS.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Called when scrollable content view of the ScrollView changes.
-- |        Handler function is passed the content width and content height as parameters: (contentWidth, contentHeight)
-- |        It's implemented using onLayout handler attached to the content container which this ScrollView renders.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMomentumScrollBegin`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has begun moving
-- | - `onMomentumScrollEnd`
-- |        Fires when scroll view has finished moving
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Fires at most once per frame during scrolling.
-- |        The frequency of the events can be contolled using the scrollEventThrottle prop.
-- | - `onScrollAnimationEnd`
-- |        Called when a scrolling animation ends.
-- | - `onScrollBeginDrag`
-- |        Fires if a user initiates a scroll gesture.
-- | - `onScrollEndDrag`
-- |        Fires when a user has finished scrolling.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `overScrollMode`
-- |        Used to override default value of overScroll mode.
-- |           Possible values:
-- |             - 'auto' - Default value, allow a user to over-scroll this view only if the content is large enough to meaningfully scroll.
-- |             - 'always' - Always allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- |             - 'never' - Never allow a user to over-scroll this view.
-- | - `pagingEnabled`
-- |        When true the scroll view stops on multiples of the scroll view's size
-- |        when scrolling. This can be used for horizontal pagination. The default
-- |        value is false.
-- | - `pinchGestureEnabled`
-- |        When true, ScrollView allows use of pinch gestures to zoom in and out.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `refreshControl`
-- |        A RefreshControl component, used to provide pull-to-refresh
-- |        functionality for the ScrollView.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        Experimental: When true offscreen child views (whose `overflow` value is
-- |        `hidden`) are removed from their native backing superview when offscreen.
-- |        This canimprove scrolling performance on long lists. The default value is
-- |        false.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll. The default value is true
-- | - `scrollEventThrottle`
-- |        This controls how often the scroll event will be fired while scrolling (in events per seconds).
-- |        A higher number yields better accuracy for code that is tracking the scroll position,
-- |        but can lead to scroll performance problems due to the volume of information being send over the bridge.
-- |        The default value is zero, which means the scroll event will be sent only once each time the view is scrolled.
-- | - `scrollIndicatorInsets`
-- |        The amount by which the scroll view indicators are inset from the edges of the scroll view.
-- |        This should normally be set to the same value as the contentInset.
-- |        Defaults to {0, 0, 0, 0}.
-- | - `scrollPerfTag`
-- |        Tag used to log scroll performance on this scroll view. Will force
-- |        momentum events to be turned on (see sendMomentumEvents). This doesn't do
-- |        anything out of the box and you need to implement a custom native
-- |        FpsListener for it to be useful.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `scrollsToTop`
-- |        When true the scroll view scrolls to top when the status bar is tapped.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `showsHorizontalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a horizontal scroll indicator.
-- | - `showsVerticalScrollIndicator`
-- |        When true, shows a vertical scroll indicator.
-- | - `snapToAlignment`
-- |        When `snapToInterval` is set, `snapToAlignment` will define the relationship of the the snapping to the scroll view.
-- |              - `start` (the default) will align the snap at the left (horizontal) or top (vertical)
-- |              - `center` will align the snap in the center
-- |              - `end` will align the snap at the right (horizontal) or bottom (vertical)
-- | - `snapToEnd`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the end of the list counts as a snap
-- |        offset. Set `snapToEnd` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll freely
-- |        between its end and the last `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `snapToInterval`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at multiples of the value of `snapToInterval`.
-- |        This can be used for paginating through children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Used in combination with `snapToAlignment` and `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less
-- |        configurable `pagingEnabled` prop.
-- | - `snapToOffsets`
-- |        When set, causes the scroll view to stop at the defined offsets. This can be used for
-- |        paginating through variously sized children that have lengths smaller than the scroll view.
-- |        Typically used in combination with `decelerationRate="fast"`. Overrides less configurable
-- |        `pagingEnabled` and `snapToInterval` props.
-- | - `snapToStart`
-- |        Use in conjuction with `snapToOffsets`. By default, the beginning of the list counts as a
-- |        snap offset. Set `snapToStart` to false to disable this behavior and allow the list to scroll
-- |        freely between its start and the first `snapToOffsets` offset. The default value is true.
-- | - `stickyHeaderIndices`
-- |        An array of child indices determining which children get docked to the
-- |        top of the screen when scrolling. For example passing
-- |        `stickyHeaderIndices={[0]}` will cause the first child to be fixed to the
-- |        top of the scroll view. This property is not supported in conjunction
-- |        with `horizontal={true}`.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Style
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `zoomScale`
-- |        The current scale of the scroll view content. The default value is 1.0.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `enabled`
-- |        If false the user won't be able to interact with the control. Default value is true.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `momentary`
-- |        If true, then selecting a segment won't persist visually.
-- |        The onValueChange callback will still work as expected.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the user taps a segment;
-- |        passes the event as an argument
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onValueChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the user taps a segment; passes the segment's value as an argument
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `selectedIndex`
-- |        The index in props.values of the segment to be (pre)selected.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        Accent color of the control.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `values`
-- |        The labels for the control's segment buttons, in order.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true the user won't be able to move the slider.
-- |        Default value is false.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `maximumTrackImage`
-- |        Assigns a maximum track image. Only static images are supported.
-- |        The leftmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track.
-- | - `maximumTrackTintColor`
-- |        The color used for the track to the right of the button.
-- |        Overrides the default blue gradient image.
-- | - `maximumValue`
-- |        Initial maximum value of the slider. Default value is 1.
-- | - `minimumTrackImage`
-- |        Assigns a minimum track image. Only static images are supported.
-- |        The rightmost pixel of the image will be stretched to fill the track.
-- | - `minimumTrackTintColor`
-- |        The color used for the track to the left of the button.
-- |        Overrides the default blue gradient image.
-- | - `minimumValue`
-- |        Initial minimum value of the slider. Default value is 0.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onSlidingComplete`
-- |        Callback called when the user finishes changing the value (e.g. when the slider is released).
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onValueChange`
-- |        Callback continuously called while the user is dragging the slider.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;

-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `step`
-- |        Step value of the slider. The value should be between 0 and (maximumValue - minimumValue). Default value is 0.
-- | - `style`
-- |        Used to style and layout the Slider. See StyleSheet.js and ViewStylePropTypes.js for more info.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in UI automation tests.
-- | - `thumbImage`
-- |        Sets an image for the thumb. Only static images are supported.
-- | - `thumbTintColor`
-- |        Color of the foreground switch grip.
-- | - `trackImage`
-- |        Assigns a single image for the track. Only static images
-- |        are supported. The center pixel of the image will be stretched
-- |        to fill the track.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.

-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `value`
-- |        Initial value of the slider. The value should be between minimumValue
-- |        and maximumValue, which default to 0 and 1 respectively.
-- |        Default value is 0.
-- |        This is not a controlled component, you don't need to update
-- |        the value during dragging.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true the user won't be able to toggle the switch. Default value is false.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening

-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release

-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:

-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onTintColor`
-- |        Background color when the switch is turned on.
-- | - `onValueChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the user toggles the switch.
-- | - `pointerEvents`

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true the user won't be able to toggle the switch.
-- |        Default value is false.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `ios_backgroundColor`
-- |        On iOS, custom color for the background.
-- |        Can be seen when the switch value is false or when the switch is disabled.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onTintColor`
-- |        Background color when the switch is turned on.
-- | - `onValueChange`
-- |        Invoked with the new value when the value changes.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `thumbColor`
-- |        Color of the foreground switch grip.
-- | - `thumbTintColor`
-- |        Color of the foreground switch grip.
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        Background color when the switch is turned off.
-- | - `trackColor`
-- |        Custom colors for the switch track
-- |        Color when false and color when true
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `value`
-- |        The value of the switch. If true the switch will be turned on.
-- |        Default value is false.

-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onPress`
-- |        Callback when this tab is being selected,
-- |        you should change the state of your component to set selected={true}.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderAsOriginal`
-- |        If set to true it renders the image as original,
-- |        it defaults to being displayed as a template
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `selected`
-- |        It specifies whether the children are visible or not. If you see a blank content, you probably forgot to add a selected one.
-- | - `selectedIcon`
-- |        A custom icon when the tab is selected.
-- |        It is ignored when a system icon is defined. If left empty, the icon will be tinted in blue.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `style`
-- |        React style object.
-- | - `systemIcon`
-- |        Items comes with a few predefined system icons.
-- |        Note that if you are using them, the title and selectedIcon will be overriden with the system ones.
-- |          enum('bookmarks', 'contacts', 'downloads', 'favorites', 'featured', 'history', 'more', 'most-recent', 'most-viewed', 'recents', 'search', 'top-rated')
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `title`
-- |        Text that appears under the icon. It is ignored when a system icon is defined.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/tabbarios.html#props>
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `barTintColor`
-- |        Background color of the tab bar
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `itemPositioning`
-- |        Specifies tab bar item positioning. Available values are:
-- |        - fill - distributes items across the entire width of the tab bar
-- |        - center - centers item in the available tab bar space
-- |        - auto (default) - distributes items dynamically according to the
-- |        user interface idiom. In a horizontally compact environment (e.g. iPhone 5)
-- |        this value defaults to `fill`, in a horizontally regular one (e.g. iPad)
-- |        it defaults to center.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.

-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening

-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tintColor`
-- |        Color of the currently selected tab icon
-- | - `translucent`
-- |        A Boolean value that indicates whether the tab bar is translucent
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `unselectedItemTintColor`
-- |        Color of unselected tab icons. Available since iOS 10.
-- | - `unselectedTintColor`
-- |        Color of text on unselected tabs

-- | see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#props>
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `allowFontScaling`
-- |        Specifies whether fonts should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings.
-- |        The default is `true`.
-- | - `autoCapitalize`
-- |        Can tell TextInput to automatically capitalize certain characters.
-- |              characters: all characters,
-- |              words: first letter of each word
-- |              sentences: first letter of each sentence (default)
-- |              none: don't auto capitalize anything
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/textinput.html#autocapitalize
-- | - `autoCompleteType`
-- |        Determines which content to suggest on auto complete, e.g.`username`.
-- |        To disable auto complete, use `off`.
-- |        *Android Only*
-- |        The following values work on Android only:
-- |        - `username`
-- |        - `password`
-- |        - `email`
-- |        - `name`
-- |        - `tel`
-- |        - `street-address`
-- |        - `postal-code`
-- |        - `cc-number`
-- |        - `cc-csc`
-- |        - `cc-exp`
-- |        - `cc-exp-month`
-- |        - `cc-exp-year`
-- |        - `off`
-- | - `autoCorrect`
-- |        If false, disables auto-correct.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `autoFocus`
-- |        If true, focuses the input on componentDidMount.
-- |        The default value is false.
-- | - `blurOnSubmit`
-- |        If true, the text field will blur when submitted.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `caretHidden`
-- |        If true, caret is hidden. The default value is false.
-- | - `clearButtonMode`
-- |        enum('never', 'while-editing', 'unless-editing', 'always')
-- |        When the clear button should appear on the right side of the text view
-- | - `clearTextOnFocus`
-- |        If true, clears the text field automatically when editing begins
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contextMenuHidden`
-- |        If true, context menu is hidden. The default value is false.
-- | - `dataDetectorTypes`
-- |        Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in the text input.
-- |        Only valid if `multiline={true}` and `editable={false}`.
-- |        By default no data types are detected.
-- |        You can provide one type or an array of many types.
-- |        Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:
-- |        - `'phoneNumber'`
-- |        - `'link'`
-- |        - `'address'`
-- |        - `'calendarEvent'`
-- |        - `'none'`
-- |        - `'all'`
-- | - `defaultValue`
-- |        Provides an initial value that will change when the user starts typing.
-- |        Useful for simple use-cases where you don't want to deal with listening to events
-- |        and updating the value prop to keep the controlled state in sync.
-- | - `disableFullscreenUI`
-- |        When false, if there is a small amount of space available around a text input (e.g. landscape orientation on a phone),
-- |           the OS may choose to have the user edit the text inside of a full screen text input mode.
-- |        When true, this feature is disabled and users will always edit the text directly inside of the text input.
-- |        Defaults to false.
-- | - `editable`
-- |        If false, text is not editable. The default value is true.
-- | - `enablesReturnKeyAutomatically`
-- |        If true, the keyboard disables the return key when there is no text and automatically enables it when there is text.
-- |        The default value is false.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `inlineImageLeft`
-- |        If defined, the provided image resource will be rendered on the left.
-- | - `inlineImagePadding`
-- |        Padding between the inline image, if any, and the text input itself.
-- | - `inputAccessoryViewID`
-- |        Used to connect to an InputAccessoryView. Not part of react-natives documentation, but present in examples and
-- |        code.
-- |        See https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/inputaccessoryview.html for more information.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardAppearance`
-- |        Determines the color of the keyboard.
-- | - `keyboardType`
-- |        enum("default", 'numeric', 'email-address', "ascii-capable", 'numbers-and-punctuation', 'url', 'number-pad', 'phone-pad', 'name-phone-pad',
-- |        'decimal-pad', 'twitter', 'web-search', 'visible-password')
-- |        Determines which keyboard to open, e.g.numeric.
-- |        The following values work across platforms: - default - numeric - email-address - phone-pad
-- |        The following values work on iOS: - ascii-capable - numbers-and-punctuation - url - number-pad - name-phone-pad - decimal-pad - twitter - web-search
-- |        The following values work on Android: - visible-password
-- | - `maxFontSizeMultiplier`
-- |        Specifies largest possible scale a font can reach when allowFontScaling is enabled. Possible values:
-- |        - null/undefined (default): inherit from the parent node or the global default (0)
-- |        - 0: no max, ignore parent/global default
-- |        - >= 1: sets the maxFontSizeMultiplier of this node to this value
-- | - `maxLength`
-- |        Limits the maximum number of characters that can be entered.
-- |        Use this instead of implementing the logic in JS to avoid flicker.
-- | - `multiline`
-- |        If true, the text input can be multiple lines. The default value is false.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `numberOfLines`
-- |        Sets the number of lines for a TextInput.
-- |        Use it with multiline set to true to be able to fill the lines.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onBlur`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input is blurred
-- | - `onChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.
-- | - `onChangeText`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input's text changes.
-- |        Changed text is passed as an argument to the callback handler.
-- | - `onContentSizeChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input's content size changes.
-- |        This will be called with
-- |        `{ nativeEvent: { contentSize: { width, height } } }`.
-- |        Only called for multiline text inputs.
-- | - `onEndEditing`
-- |        Callback that is called when text input ends.
-- | - `onFocus`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input is focused
-- | - `onKeyPress`
-- |        Callback that is called when a key is pressed.
-- |        This will be called with
-- |          `{ nativeEvent: { key: keyValue } }`
-- |        where keyValue is 'Enter' or 'Backspace' for respective keys and the typed-in character otherwise including ' ' for space.
-- |        Fires before onChange callbacks.
-- |        Note: on Android only the inputs from soft keyboard are handled, not the hardware keyboard inputs.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onScroll`
-- |        Invoked on content scroll with
-- |          `{ nativeEvent: { contentOffset: { x, y } } }`.
-- |        May also contain other properties from ScrollEvent but on Android contentSize is not provided for performance reasons.
-- | - `onSelectionChange`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input selection is changed.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onSubmitEditing`
-- |        Callback that is called when the text input's submit button is pressed.
-- | - `placeholder`
-- |        The string that will be rendered before text input has been entered
-- | - `placeholderTextColor`
-- |        The text color of the placeholder string
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `returnKeyLabel`
-- |        Sets the return key to the label. Use it instead of `returnKeyType`.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `returnKeyType`
-- |        enum('default', 'go', 'google', 'join', 'next', 'route', 'search', 'send', 'yahoo', 'done', 'emergency-call')
-- |        Determines how the return key should look.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        If false, scrolling of the text view will be disabled. The default value is true. Only works with multiline={true}
-- | - `secureTextEntry`
-- |        If true, the text input obscures the text entered so that sensitive text like passwords stay secure.
-- |        The default value is false.
-- | - `selectTextOnFocus`
-- |        If true, all text will automatically be selected on focus
-- | - `selection`
-- |        The start and end of the text input's selection. Set start and end to
-- |        the same value to position the cursor.
-- | - `selectionColor`
-- |        The highlight (and cursor on ios) color of the text input
-- | - `selectionState`
-- |        See DocumentSelectionState.js, some state that is responsible for maintaining selection information for a document
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `spellCheck`
-- |        If false, disables spell-check style (i.e. red underlines). The default value is inherited from autoCorrect
-- | - `style`
-- |        Styles
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests
-- | - `textAlignVertical`
-- |        Vertically align text when `multiline` is set to true
-- | - `textBreakStrategy`
-- |        Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+, possible values are simple, highQuality, balanced
-- |        The default value is simple.
-- | - `textContentType`
-- |        Give the keyboard and the system information about the expected
-- |        semantic meaning for the content that users enter.
-- |        For iOS 11+ you can set `textContentType` to `username` or `password` to
-- |        enable autofill of login details from the device keychain.
-- |        For iOS 12+ `newPassword` can be used to indicate a new password input the
-- |        user may want to save in the keychain, and `oneTimeCode` can be used to indicate
-- |        that a field can be autofilled by a code arriving in an SMS.
-- |        To disable autofill, set textContentType to `none`.
-- |        Possible values for `textContentType` are:
-- |          - `'none'`
-- |          - `'URL'`
-- |          - `'addressCity'`
-- |          - `'addressCityAndState'`
-- |          - `'addressState'`
-- |          - `'countryName'`
-- |          - `'creditCardNumber'`
-- |          - `'emailAddress'`
-- |          - `'familyName'`
-- |          - `'fullStreetAddress'`
-- |          - `'givenName'`
-- |          - `'jobTitle'`
-- |          - `'location'`
-- |          - `'middleName'`
-- |          - `'name'`
-- |          - `'namePrefix'`
-- |          - `'nameSuffix'`
-- |          - `'nickname'`
-- |          - `'organizationName'`
-- |          - `'postalCode'`
-- |          - `'streetAddressLine1'`
-- |          - `'streetAddressLine2'`
-- |          - `'sublocality'`
-- |          - `'telephoneNumber'`
-- |          - `'username'`
-- |          - `'password'`
-- |          - `'newPassword'`
-- |          - `'oneTimeCode'`
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `underlineColorAndroid`
-- |        The color of the textInput underline.
-- | - `value`
-- |        The value to show for the text input. TextInput is a controlled component,
-- |        which means the native value will be forced to match this value prop if provided.
-- |        For most uses this works great, but in some cases this may cause flickering - one common cause is preventing edits by keeping value the same.
-- |        In addition to simply setting the same value, either set editable={false},
-- |        or set/update maxLength to prevent unwanted edits without flicker.

-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `adjustsFontSizeToFit`
-- |        Specifies whether font should be scaled down automatically to fit given style constraints.
-- | - `allowFontScaling`
-- |        Specifies whether fonts should scale to respect Text Size accessibility settings.
-- |        The default is `true`.
-- | - `ellipsizeMode`
-- |        This can be one of the following values:
-- |        - `head` - The line is displayed so that the end fits in the container and the missing text
-- |        at the beginning of the line is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. e.g., "...wxyz"
-- |        - `middle` - The line is displayed so that the beginning and end fit in the container and the
-- |        missing text in the middle is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. "ab...yz"
-- |        - `tail` - The line is displayed so that the beginning fits in the container and the
-- |        missing text at the end of the line is indicated by an ellipsis glyph. e.g., "abcd..."
-- |        - `clip` - Lines are not drawn past the edge of the text container.
-- |        The default is `tail`.
-- |        `numberOfLines` must be set in conjunction with this prop.
-- |        > `clip` is working only for iOS
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `lineBreakMode`
-- |        Line Break mode. Works only with numberOfLines.
-- |        clip is working only for iOS
-- | - `maxFontSizeMultiplier`
-- |        Specifies largest possible scale a font can reach when allowFontScaling is enabled. Possible values:
-- |        - null/undefined (default): inherit from the parent node or the global default (0)
-- |        - 0: no max, ignore parent/global default
-- |        - >= 1: sets the maxFontSizeMultiplier of this node to this value
-- | - `minimumFontScale`
-- |        Specifies smallest possible scale a font can reach when adjustsFontSizeToFit is enabled. (values 0.01-1.0).
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `numberOfLines`
-- |        Used to truncate the text with an ellipsis after computing the text
-- |        layout, including line wrapping, such that the total number of lines
-- |        does not exceed this number.
-- |        This prop is commonly used with `ellipsizeMode`.
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onLongPress`
-- |        This function is called on long press.
-- |        e.g., `onLongPress={this.increaseSize}>``
-- |             *
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onPress`
-- |        This function is called on press.
-- |        Text intrinsically supports press handling with a default highlight state (which can be disabled with suppressHighlighting).
-- | - `selectable`
-- |        Lets the user select text, to use the native copy and paste functionality.
-- | - `selectionColor`
-- |        The highlight color of the text.
-- | - `style`
-- |        see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text.html#style>
-- | - `suppressHighlighting`
-- |        When `true`, no visual change is made when text is pressed down. By
-- |        default, a gray oval highlights the text on press down.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `textBreakStrategy`
-- |        Set text break strategy on Android API Level 23+

-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `actions`
-- |        Sets possible actions on the toolbar as part of the action menu. These are displayed as icons
-- |        or text on the right side of the widget. If they don't fit they are placed in an 'overflow'
-- |        menu.
-- |        This property takes an array of objects, where each object has the following keys:
-- |        * `title`: **required**, the title of this action
-- |        * `icon`: the icon for this action, e.g. `require('./some_icon.png')`

-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `logo`
-- |        Sets the toolbar logo.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `navIcon`
-- |        Sets the navigation icon.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onActionSelected`
-- |        Callback that is called when an action is selected. The only
-- |        argument that is passed to the callback is the position of the
-- |        action in the actions array.
-- | - `onIconClicked`
-- |        Callback called when the icon is selected.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `overflowIcon`
-- |        Sets the overflow icon.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `rtl`
-- |        Used to set the toolbar direction to RTL.
-- |        In addition to this property you need to add
-- |        android:supportsRtl="true"
-- |        to your application AndroidManifest.xml and then call
-- |        setLayoutDirection(LayoutDirection.RTL) in your MainActivity
-- |        onCreate method.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `subtitle`
-- |        Sets the toolbar subtitle.
-- | - `subtitleColor`
-- |        Sets the toolbar subtitle color.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `title`
-- |        Sets the toolbar title.
-- | - `titleColor`
-- |        Sets the toolbar title color.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `activeOpacity`
-- |        Determines what the opacity of the wrapped view should be when touch is active.
-- | - `delayLongPress`
-- |        Delay in ms, from onPressIn, before onLongPress is called.
-- | - `delayPressIn`
-- |        Delay in ms, from the start of the touch, before onPressIn is called.
-- | - `delayPressOut`
-- |        Delay in ms, from the release of the touch, before onPressOut is called.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true, disable all interactions for this component.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* TV preferred focus (see documentation for the View component).
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far your touch can start away from the button.
-- |        This is added to pressRetentionOffset when moving off of the button.
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits
-- |        two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).

-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onBlur`
-- |        When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when
-- |        the OS-specific concept of "blur" occurs, meaning the element lost focus.
-- |        Some platforms may not have the concept of blur.
-- | - `onFocus`
-- |        When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when
-- |        the OS-specific concept of "focus" occurs. Some platforms may not have
-- |        the concept of focus.
-- | - `onHideUnderlay`
-- |        Called immediately after the underlay is hidden
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: {layout: {x, y, width, height}}}
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onPress`
-- |        Called when the touch is released,
-- |        but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).
-- | - `onShowUnderlay`
-- |        Called immediately after the underlay is shown
-- | - `pressRetentionOffset`
-- |        When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your
-- |        touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.
-- |        Once deactivated, try moving it back and you'll see that the button
-- |        is once again reactivated! Move it back and forth several times
-- |        while the scroll view is disabled. Ensure you pass in a constant
-- |        to reduce memory allocations.
-- | - `style`
-- |        see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/view.html#style>
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |        enabled: If true, parallax effects are enabled.  Defaults to true.
-- |        shiftDistanceX: Defaults to 2.0.
-- |        shiftDistanceY: Defaults to 2.0.
-- |        tiltAngle: Defaults to 0.05.
-- |        magnification: Defaults to 1.0.
-- |        pressMagnification: Defaults to 1.0.
-- |        pressDuration: Defaults to 0.3.
-- |        pressDelay: Defaults to 0.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `underlayColor`
-- |        The color of the underlay that will show through when the touch is active.

-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `background`
-- |        Determines the type of background drawable that's going to be used to display feedback.
-- |        It takes an object with type property and extra data depending on the type.
-- |        It's recommended to use one of the following static methods to generate that dictionary:
-- |              1) TouchableNativeFeedback.SelectableBackground() - will create object that represents android theme's
-- |                 default background for selectable elements (?android:attr/selectableItemBackground)
-- |              2) TouchableNativeFeedback.SelectableBackgroundBorderless() - will create object that represent android
-- |                 theme's default background for borderless selectable elements
-- |                 (?android:attr/selectableItemBackgroundBorderless). Available on android API level 21+
-- |              3) TouchableNativeFeedback.Ripple(color, borderless) - will create object that represents ripple drawable
-- |                 with specified color (as a string). If property borderless evaluates to true the ripple will render
-- |                 outside of the view bounds (see native actionbar buttons as an example of that behavior). This background
-- |                 type is available on Android API level 21+
-- | - `delayLongPress`
-- |        Delay in ms, from onPressIn, before onLongPress is called.
-- | - `delayPressIn`
-- |        Delay in ms, from the start of the touch, before onPressIn is called.
-- | - `delayPressOut`
-- |        Delay in ms, from the release of the touch, before onPressOut is called.
-- | - `disabled`
-- |        If true, disable all interactions for this component.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* TV preferred focus (see documentation for the View component).
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far your touch can start away from the button.
-- |        This is added to pressRetentionOffset when moving off of the button.
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch hits
-- |        two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onBlur`
-- |        When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when
-- |        the OS-specific concept of "blur" occurs, meaning the element lost focus.
-- |        Some platforms may not have the concept of blur.
-- | - `onFocus`
-- |        When `accessible` is true (which is the default) this may be called when
-- |        the OS-specific concept of "focus" occurs. Some platforms may not have
-- |        the concept of focus.
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: {layout: {x, y, width, height}}}
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onPress`
-- |        Called when the touch is released,
-- |        but not if cancelled (e.g. by a scroll that steals the responder lock).
-- | - `pressRetentionOffset`
-- |        When the scroll view is disabled, this defines how far your
-- |        touch may move off of the button, before deactivating the button.
-- |        Once deactivated, try moving it back and you'll see that the button
-- |        is once again reactivated! Move it back and forth several times
-- |        while the scroll view is disabled. Ensure you pass in a constant
-- |        to reduce memory allocations.
-- | - `style`
-- |        //FIXME: not in doc but available in examples
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |        enabled: If true, parallax effects are enabled.  Defaults to true.
-- |        shiftDistanceX: Defaults to 2.0.
-- |        shiftDistanceY: Defaults to 2.0.
-- |        tiltAngle: Defaults to 0.05.

-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `initialPage`
-- |        Index of initial page that should be selected. Use `setPage` method to
-- |        update the page, and `onPageSelected` to monitor page changes
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `keyboardDismissMode`
-- |        Determines whether the keyboard gets dismissed in response to a drag.
-- |           - 'none' (the default), drags do not dismiss the keyboard.
-- |           - 'on-drag', the keyboard is dismissed when a drag begins.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onPageScroll`
-- |        Executed when transitioning between pages (ether because of animation for
-- |        the requested page change or when user is swiping/dragging between pages)
-- |        The `event.nativeEvent` object for this callback will carry following data:
-- |          - position - index of first page from the left that is currently visible
-- |          - offset - value from range [0,1) describing stage between page transitions.
-- |            Value x means that (1 - x) fraction of the page at "position" index is
-- |            visible, and x fraction of the next page is visible.
-- | - `onPageScrollStateChanged`
-- |        Function called when the page scrolling state has changed.
-- |        The page scrolling state can be in 3 states:
-- |        - idle, meaning there is no interaction with the page scroller happening at the time
-- |        - dragging, meaning there is currently an interaction with the page scroller
-- |        - settling, meaning that there was an interaction with the page scroller, and the
-- |           page scroller is now finishing it's closing or opening animation
-- | - `onPageSelected`
-- |        This callback will be called once ViewPager finish navigating to selected page
-- |        (when user swipes between pages). The `event.nativeEvent` object passed to this
-- |        callback will have following fields:
-- |          - position - index of page that has been selected
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pageMargin`
-- |        Blank space to show between pages. This is only visible while scrolling, pages are still
-- |        edge-to-edge.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        When false, the content does not scroll.
-- |        The default value is true.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.

-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__

-- | see <https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/webview.html#props>
-- | - `accessibilityActions`
-- |        Provides an array of custom actions available for accessibility.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityComponentType`
-- |        In some cases, we also want to alert the end user of the type of selected component (i.e., that it is a “button”).
-- |        If we were using native buttons, this would work automatically. Since we are using javascript, we need to
-- |        provide a bit more context for TalkBack. To do so, you must specify the ‘accessibilityComponentType’ property
-- |        for any UI component. For instances, we support ‘button’, ‘radiobutton_checked’ and ‘radiobutton_unchecked’ and so on.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityElementsHidden`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether the accessibility elements contained within this accessibility element
-- |        are hidden to the screen reader.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityHint`
-- |        An accessibility hint helps users understand what will happen when they perform an action on the accessibility element when that result is not obvious from the accessibility label.
-- | - `accessibilityIgnoresInvertColors`
-- |        https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/accessibility#accessibilityignoresinvertcolorsios
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityLabel`
-- |        Overrides the text that's read by the screen reader when the user interacts with the element. By default, the
-- |        label is constructed by traversing all the children and accumulating all the Text nodes separated by space.
-- | - `accessibilityLiveRegion`
-- |        Indicates to accessibility services whether the user should be notified when this view changes.
-- |        Works for Android API >= 19 only.
-- |        See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/view/View.html#attr_android:accessibilityLiveRegion for references.
-- |         __*platform* android__
-- | - `accessibilityRole`
-- |        Accessibility Role tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the type of element that is focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityStates`
-- |        Accessibility State tells a person using either VoiceOver on iOS or TalkBack on Android the state of the element currently focused on.
-- | - `accessibilityTraits`
-- |        Accessibility traits tell a person using VoiceOver what kind of element they have selected.
-- |        Is this element a label? A button? A header? These questions are answered by accessibilityTraits.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessibilityViewIsModal`
-- |        A Boolean value indicating whether VoiceOver should ignore the elements within views that are siblings of the receiver.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `accessible`
-- |        When true, indicates that the view is an accessibility element.
-- |        By default, all the touchable elements are accessible.
-- | - `allowFileAccess`
-- |        Sets whether the webview allows access to the file system.
-- | - `allowsInlineMediaPlayback`
-- |        Determines whether HTML5 videos play inline or use the native
-- |        full-screen controller. default value false
-- |        NOTE : "In order * for video to play inline, not only does
-- |        this property need to be set to true, but the video element
-- |        in the HTML document must also include the webkit-playsinline
-- |        attribute."
-- | - `automaticallyAdjustContentInsets`
-- |        Controls whether to adjust the content inset for web views that are
-- |        placed behind a navigation bar, tab bar, or toolbar. The default value
-- |        is `true`.
-- | - `bounces`
-- |        Boolean value that determines whether the web view bounces
-- |        when it reaches the edge of the content. The default value is `true`.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `collapsable`
-- |        Views that are only used to layout their children or otherwise don't draw anything
-- |        may be automatically removed from the native hierarchy as an optimization.
-- |        Set this property to false to disable this optimization and ensure that this View exists in the native view hierarchy.
-- | - `contentInset`
-- |        The amount by which the web view content is inset from the edges of
-- |        the scroll view. Defaults to {top: 0, left: 0, bottom: 0, right: 0}.
-- | - `dataDetectorTypes`
-- |        Determines the types of data converted to clickable URLs in
-- |        the web view’s content. By default only phone numbers are detected.
-- |        You can provide one type or an array of many types.
-- |        Possible values for `dataDetectorTypes` are:
-- |        - `'phoneNumber'`
-- |        - `'link'`
-- |        - `'address'`
-- |        - `'calendarEvent'`
-- |        - `'none'`
-- |        - `'all'`
-- | - `decelerationRate`
-- |        A floating-point number that determines how quickly the scroll
-- |        view decelerates after the user lifts their finger. You may also
-- |        use string shortcuts "normal" and "fast" which match the
-- |        underlying iOS settings for UIScrollViewDecelerationRateNormal
-- |        and UIScrollViewDecelerationRateFast respectively.
-- |        - normal: 0.998 - fast: 0.99 (the default for iOS WebView)
-- | - `domStorageEnabled`
-- |        Used on Android only, controls whether DOM Storage is enabled
-- |        or not android
-- | - `hasTVPreferredFocus`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be set to true to force the Apple TV focus engine to move focus to this view.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `hitSlop`
-- |        This defines how far a touch event can start away from the view.
-- |        Typical interface guidelines recommend touch targets that are at least
-- |        30 - 40 points/density-independent pixels. If a Touchable view has
-- |        a height of 20 the touchable height can be extended to 40 with
-- |        hitSlop={{top: 10, bottom: 10, left: 0, right: 0}}
-- |        NOTE The touch area never extends past the parent view bounds and
-- |        the Z-index of sibling views always takes precedence if a touch
-- |        hits two overlapping views.
-- | - `importantForAccessibility`
-- |        Controls how view is important for accessibility which is if it fires accessibility events
-- |        and if it is reported to accessibility services that query the screen.
-- |        Works for Android only. See http://developer.android.com/reference/android/R.attr.html#importantForAccessibility for references.
-- |        Possible values:
-- |              'auto' - The system determines whether the view is important for accessibility - default (recommended).
-- |              'yes' - The view is important for accessibility.
-- |              'no' - The view is not important for accessibility.
-- |              'no-hide-descendants' - The view is not important for accessibility, nor are any of its descendant views.
-- | - `injectedJavaScript`
-- |        Set this to provide JavaScript that will be injected into the web page
-- |        when the view loads.
-- | - `isTVSelectable`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* When set to true, this view will be focusable
-- |        and navigable using the Apple TV remote.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `javaScriptEnabled`
-- |        Used for android only, JS is enabled by default for WebView on iOS
-- | - `mediaPlaybackRequiresUserAction`
-- |        Determines whether HTML5 audio & videos require the user to tap
-- |        before they can start playing. The default value is false.
-- | - `mixedContentMode`
-- |        Specifies the mixed content mode. i.e WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin.
-- |        Possible values for mixedContentMode are:
-- |        'never' (default) - WebView will not allow a secure origin to load content from an insecure origin.
-- |        'always' - WebView will allow a secure origin to load content from any other origin, even if that origin is insecure.
-- |        'compatibility' - WebView will attempt to be compatible with the approach of a modern web browser with regard to mixed content.
-- | - `nativeConfig`
-- |        Override the native component used to render the WebView. Enables a custom native
-- |        WebView which uses the same JavaScript as the original WebView.
-- | - `nativeID`
-- |        Used to reference react managed views from native code.
-- | - `needsOffscreenAlphaCompositing`
-- |        Whether this view needs to rendered offscreen and composited with an alpha in order to preserve 100% correct colors and blending behavior.
-- |        The default (false) falls back to drawing the component and its children
-- |        with an alpha applied to the paint used to draw each element instead of rendering the full component offscreen and compositing it back with an alpha value.
-- |        This default may be noticeable and undesired in the case where the View you are setting an opacity on
-- |        has multiple overlapping elements (e.g. multiple overlapping Views, or text and a background).
-- |        Rendering offscreen to preserve correct alpha behavior is extremely expensive
-- |        and hard to debug for non-native developers, which is why it is not turned on by default.
-- |        If you do need to enable this property for an animation,
-- |        consider combining it with renderToHardwareTextureAndroid if the view contents are static (i.e. it doesn't need to be redrawn each frame).
-- |        If that property is enabled, this View will be rendered off-screen once,
-- |        saved in a hardware texture, and then composited onto the screen with an alpha each frame without having to switch rendering targets on the GPU.
-- | - `onAccessibilityAction`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function
-- |        when the user performs an accessibility custom action.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onAccessibilityTap`
-- |        When `accessible` is true, the system will try to invoke this function when the user performs accessibility tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onError`
-- |        Invoked when load fails
-- | - `onLayout`
-- |        Invoked on mount and layout changes with
-- |        {nativeEvent: { layout: {x, y, width, height}}}.
-- | - `onLoad`
-- |        Invoked when load finish
-- | - `onLoadEnd`
-- |        Invoked when load either succeeds or fails
-- | - `onLoadStart`
-- |        Invoked on load start
-- | - `onMagicTap`
-- |        When accessible is true, the system will invoke this function when the user performs the magic tap gesture.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `onMessage`
-- |        Invoked when window.postMessage is called from WebView.
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponder`
-- |        Called for every touch move on the View when it is not the responder: does this view want to "claim" touch responsiveness?
-- | - `onMoveShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `onNavigationStateChange`
-- |        Function that is invoked when the `WebView` loading starts or ends.
-- | - `onResponderEnd`
-- |        If the View returns true and attempts to become the responder, one of the following will happen:
-- | - `onResponderGrant`
-- |        The View is now responding for touch events.
-- |        This is the time to highlight and show the user what is happening
-- | - `onResponderMove`
-- |        If the view is responding, the following handlers can be called:
-- |        The user is moving their finger
-- | - `onResponderReject`
-- |        Something else is the responder right now and will not release it
-- | - `onResponderRelease`
-- |        Fired at the end of the touch, ie "touchUp"
-- | - `onResponderTerminate`
-- |        The responder has been taken from the View.
-- |        Might be taken by other views after a call to onResponderTerminationRequest,
-- |        or might be taken by the OS without asking (happens with control center/ notification center on iOS)
-- | - `onResponderTerminationRequest`
-- |        Something else wants to become responder.
-- |        Should this view release the responder? Returning true allows release
-- | - `onShouldStartLoadWithRequest`
-- |        Allows custom handling of any webview requests by a JS handler.
-- |        Return true or false from this method to continue loading the
-- |        request.
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponder`
-- |        A view can become the touch responder by implementing the correct negotiation methods.
-- |        There are two methods to ask the view if it wants to become responder:
-- |        Does this view want to become responder on the start of a touch?
-- | - `onStartShouldSetResponderCapture`
-- |        onStartShouldSetResponder and onMoveShouldSetResponder are called with a bubbling pattern,
-- |        where the deepest node is called first.
-- |        That means that the deepest component will become responder when multiple Views return true for *ShouldSetResponder handlers.
-- |        This is desirable in most cases, because it makes sure all controls and buttons are usable.
-- |        However, sometimes a parent will want to make sure that it becomes responder.
-- |        This can be handled by using the capture phase.
-- |        Before the responder system bubbles up from the deepest component,
-- |        it will do a capture phase, firing on*ShouldSetResponderCapture.
-- |        So if a parent View wants to prevent the child from becoming responder on a touch start,
-- |        it should have a onStartShouldSetResponderCapture handler which returns true.
-- | - `originWhitelist`
-- |        List of origin strings to allow being navigated to.
-- |        The strings allow wildcards and get matched against just the origin (not the full URL).
-- |        If the user taps to navigate to a new page but the new page is not in this whitelist, the URL will be handled by the OS.
-- |        The default whitelisted origins are "http://" and "https://".
-- | - `pointerEvents`
-- |        In the absence of auto property, none is much like CSS's none value. box-none is as if you had applied the CSS class:
-- |        .box-none {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-none * {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        box-only is the equivalent of
-- |        .box-only {
-- |           pointer-events: all;
-- |        }
-- |        .box-only * {
-- |           pointer-events: none;
-- |        }
-- |        But since pointerEvents does not affect layout/appearance, and we are already deviating from the spec by adding additional modes,
-- |        we opt to not include pointerEvents on style. On some platforms, we would need to implement it as a className anyways. Using style or not is an implementation detail of the platform.
-- | - `removeClippedSubviews`
-- |        This is a special performance property exposed by RCTView and is useful for scrolling content when there are many subviews,
-- |        most of which are offscreen. For this property to be effective, it must be applied to a view that contains many subviews that extend outside its bound.
-- |        The subviews must also have overflow: hidden, as should the containing view (or one of its superviews).
-- | - `renderError`
-- |        Function that returns a view to show if there's an error.
-- | - `renderLoading`
-- |        Function that returns a loading indicator.
-- | - `renderToHardwareTextureAndroid`
-- |        Whether this view should render itself (and all of its children) into a single hardware texture on the GPU.
-- |        On Android, this is useful for animations and interactions that only modify opacity, rotation, translation, and/or scale:
-- |        in those cases, the view doesn't have to be redrawn and display lists don't need to be re-executed. The texture can just be
-- |        re-used and re-composited with different parameters. The downside is that this can use up limited video memory, so this prop should be set back to false at the end of the interaction/animation.
-- | - `saveFormDataDisabled`
-- |        Controls whether form autocomplete data should be saved
-- | - `scalesPageToFit`
-- |        sets whether the webpage scales to fit the view and the user can change the scale
-- | - `scrollEnabled`
-- |        Boolean value that determines whether scrolling is enabled in the
-- |        `WebView`. The default value is `true`.
-- | - `shouldRasterizeIOS`
-- |        Whether this view should be rendered as a bitmap before compositing.
-- |        On iOS, this is useful for animations and interactions that do not modify this component's dimensions nor its children;
-- |        for example, when translating the position of a static view, rasterization allows the renderer to reuse a cached bitmap of a static view
-- |        and quickly composite it during each frame.
-- |        Rasterization incurs an off-screen drawing pass and the bitmap consumes memory.
-- |        Test and measure when using this property.
-- | - `startInLoadingState`
-- |        Boolean value that forces the `WebView` to show the loading view
-- |        on the first load.
-- | - `testID`
-- |        Used to locate this view in end-to-end tests.
-- | - `tvParallaxMagnification`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 1.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxProperties`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* Object with properties to control Apple TV parallax effects.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceX`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxShiftDistanceY`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 2.0.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `tvParallaxTiltAngle`
-- |        *(Apple TV only)* May be used to change the appearance of the Apple TV parallax effect when this view goes in or out of focus.  Defaults to 0.05.
-- |         __*platform* ios__
-- | - `useWebKit`
-- |        If `true`, use WKWebView instead of UIWebView.
-- | - `userAgent`
-- |        Sets the user-agent for the WebView.
