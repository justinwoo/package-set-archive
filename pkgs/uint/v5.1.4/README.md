This module provides 32-bit unsigned integers. Provided type `UInt`
is based on the `x >>> 0` trick analogous to how PureScript's `Int`
is based on `x | 0` trick.
The type has range from `0` to `4294967295`.

Documentation can be found on [Pursuit](https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-uint).
