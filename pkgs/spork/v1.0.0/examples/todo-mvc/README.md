# TodoMVC

TodoMVC is a small todo-list application that's often used to compare
JavaScript frameworks. You can compare this version to
[Elm's version](https://github.com/evancz/elm-todomvc).

## Notes

Some versions of Safari don't (by default) allow local storage of
files. You can change the default in the `Develop` menu. Click on
`Disable Local File Restrictions`.
