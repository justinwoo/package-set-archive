PureScript-Milkis Guide
============================

This is a guide for the PureScript library `Milkis <https://github.com/justinwoo/purescript-milkis>`_, a library for easily making HTTP requests by using the `Fetch API <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API/Using_Fetch>`_ and getting the results in `Aff <https://pursuit.purescript.org/packages/purescript-aff>`_.

This library allows you to use fetch from the Browser by using the ``window`` implementation, and from Node by using the `node-fetch <https://github.com/bitinn/node-fetch>`_ library.

.. note:: If there is a topic you would like more help with that is not in this guide, open a issue in the Github repo for it to request it.
